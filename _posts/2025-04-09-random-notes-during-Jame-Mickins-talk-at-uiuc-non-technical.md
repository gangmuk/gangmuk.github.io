# Random notes during Thomas Wenisch talk at UIUC

You need to talk to your advisor about existential concern early 

Most of times, the solution for your problem is to find a person and talk to that person that will disspell the confusion that you have. Find people and talk to them when you are lost.

Donâ€™t spend more than two days being lost

If it does not elevate the main narrative, idea, then cut it off.

Take a video and watch yourself (with ice cream)

Scripting is really good. hard to improvise in highly technical talk especially for junior researchers

People like stories

Establish the tone that you are going to use throughout the talk and be consistent with the same tone
