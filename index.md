# Bio
 I earned my M.S at UNIST, South Korea as a member of OMNIA lab led by Professor Myeongjae Jeon. I graduated from Computer Science and Engineering department at UNIST in 2018 where I got my Bachelor degree. Currently, I am working for Rebellions Inc. as a research intern.
 My research interest is designing and implementing large-scale system for machine learning, hardware-software co-designed system, resource disaggregated system for future cloud computing. In terms of application, I am into machine learning workloads.

# Research Projects
## Zico: Efficient GPU sharing for concurrent deep neural network training workloads.
- Designed and implemented a DL framework that efficiently supports concurrent DNN training jobs through fine-grained GPU sharing. 
- Analyzed resource demand of a variety of DNN training workloads in terms of host and GPU.
- Proposed a novel prediction-based scheduler for co-scheduling DNN training jobs which maximizes resource utilization and throughput.
- Suggested how to achieve safe and efficient memory management that handles asynchrony between a host and a device.

## AOMG: Quantile approximate algorithm for data center telemetry monitoring.
- Proposed novel value error-based quantile approximation algorithm and data structure instead of the old rank error-based quantile approximation. 
- Achieved higher performance in terms of throughput and accuracy compared to previous algorithms.
