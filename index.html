 I earned my M.S at UNIST, South Korea as a member of OMNIA lab led by Professor Myeongjae Jeon. I graduated from Computer Science and Engineering department at UNIST in 2018 where I got my Bachelor degree. Currently, I am working for Rebellions Inc. as a research intern.
 My research interest is designing and implementing large-scale system for machine learning, hardware-software co-designed system, resource disaggregated system for future cloud computing. In terms of application, I am into machine learning workloads.
