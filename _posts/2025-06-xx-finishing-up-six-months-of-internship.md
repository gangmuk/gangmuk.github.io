A bag of some (new) thoughts, opinions, and lessons I have had for the last six months of my life (Jan-Jun, 2025) at Renton, Bellevue, and Seattle while doing internship.

### Professional relationship, professional work, and research
It was my second time of working at the industry. The first one was at Rebellions, Korea. I was supposed to do research but I didn't feel completely comfortable with the freedom given to me. I wasn't sure about what research I should do, and worried too much about not making success for the research project. So, I didn't do research but did engineering. It was my choice and still good experience, but thinking back, I should have done research. At least I should have tried. This time at Bytedance, I insist (and there was no choice) on trying to do research project. It was very difficult to find and choose the problem. There was nothing planned by the team or manager. Rather, they gave me freedom to explore and choose the problem. It was not easy path and maybe less efficient since I spent too much time on finding the problem instead of working on the problem. But it was right thing to do as research. Anyway, that's what I am supposed to do at my PhD.


### All are just people in the end
As you are more into professional career, you will think that there are so many unbelievably capable, smart, unreachable people. If you look at LinkedIn, you will think that to be successful, to get a good job, to work at a good team, you should be as good as they are, which seems very difficult... But that's not true. All the successful products and services, iphone, netflix, instagram, tiktok, they are all just made by people. They are not aliens. And what I realized (and what I was guessing before doing this internship), 

### Places
Kinda unfortunate but I didn't really have much explored Seattle and nearby area. For example, I haven't had chance to explore famous natures around Seattle such as lots of waterfalls, trails, hiking places, not even Mountain Rainer (I only saw it when I was crossing the bridge between bellevue and seattle). I am not sad about it but it could have been better if there were other interns at the company or friends from my school that I can hang out together. Since my internship started at Jan and is ending at June, there was no friends here. I tried one tech meetup to make friends but it did not work. I couldn't find someone clicked. However though, I think I spend time well alone. And there are two places that I went almost every weekend and sometimes even at weekdays when I don't want to go to the office. These became very special and meaningful place for me. These places feel almost like friends. They are Zoka Cafe and Greenlake. I visited them always together. Zoka from morning till it closes and then went to Greenlake to see people, water, tree, sunset and also to run.

#### Zoka Cafe, Seattle
Usually, I like exploring different places but this time I exclusively went to Zoka ever since I found it. I can't explain why and how but this place was just perfect for me. I get there at ~11am and stay there until 5pm all the time. and I didn't feel like I wanted to leave the cafe or get bored. Good coffee, right amount of noise, diverse people, Staying at comfortable cafe makes

#### Greenlake, Seattle


### House
- Commuting with driving seems pretty doable. Less time efficient but can help me to do more focused work during the day.
- Living in a quiet neighborhood where there is no city noise like car driving, people talking made me more free man at the house. Like shouting, doing my own stuff more, talking to myself more.
- Trees around your house makes staying in the house less stuffy.

### Good people

#### Scott
Many days, I had struggling feeling doing my internship. The project (problem that I am going to solve) was not clear for a long time. I spent lots of times on things that didn't help my project. Things were not working. I was not sure if I could make some meaningful results at the end of internship, etc. By lunch time or dinner time, my brain was fried and head was filled with full of frustrating emotion. But when I went to pick up my food, I talk to Scott (who distributes the foods). He said "Hey Gaaaaaangmuuuuuk" with some funny lauging and nice smile. The 20 seconds of genuine interaction with this nice guy helped me a lot and helped me from worse frustration. I was just genuinly happy that someone was remembering me as individual beyond just "hi, how are you", and sometimes saying "You didn't come to the office last week. I was afraid that you left the company!". That was **the only** moment I smiled and laughend when I was in the office. I am grateful for him. Wish I could have more fun outside the office. It would have been amazing! 
The interesting fact is I didn't have lots of interaction with these people at all. Max 1 minute when we talk, usually 30 seconds and max two times with Scott one for lunch pick up and the other for dinner pick up. However, if I can talk to only one person in the team, I would do with Scott and he made the internship experience much better. And he and his food crew were the only people in the sixth floor office lauging as loud as everybody could hear. I really liked it and believed that boosted other people energy.

#### Guang Mo
He has just such a great sense of humor. I wish I had that too. He also has nice smile (he has such kind moods of eyes) and always **takes one more step** and said "Hey man, how are you doing? Is everything going okay?". One more step is very very important and that makes whole lot of difference about me feeling about the interaction. It seems he genuinely wants to talk to me and curious about me and what I was doing. It was completely different from professional "hey how are you". Just talking to him more like 30 seconds gave me positive energy. I thank this man too. 


#### Interaction with other people with money related
- I am not good at interacting with other people with money related and I do not like it. It tires me and makes me overthink and stressed. The fact that a person 'looks' nice DOES NOT mean anything when money is related. I shouldn't be moosh and stick to the rules. I felt I disrespected myself when I gave more money that I didn't need to based on the contract just because utility was high. I felt humilated. I should try to avoid this relationship if possible by doing through third party. That's why there are third people who manage these tasks professionally, such as property management, rent company, etc. They act based on rules, so less personal and more predicatable.
