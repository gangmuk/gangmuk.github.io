<p>
I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at the Computer Science Department of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am working with Professor <a href="https://pbg.cs.illinois.edu">Brighten Godfrey</a>, and also closely working with Professor <a href="https://radhikam.web.illinois.edu/">Radhika Mittal</a>. 

Also, I earned my Bachelor and Master at the Computer Science at UNIST, South Korea, working with Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/myeongjae/">Myeongjae Jeon</a>.
</p>

<p>
I am broadly interested in system and networking. 
Current interest is to make infrastructure smarter by connecting different cluster resource schedulers and also to make infrastructure more application-aware to improve application performance, reduce monetary cost and enhance cluster reliability. More specifically, some of my projects are/were request routing for microservice applications in geo-distributed multi-clusters (SLATE), machine learning based request router for LLM inference application in heterogeneous GPU clusters, and verifying cluster manager to make it more reliable (Kivi).

<!-- All of my works heavily involve K8S and all done in K8S and some with Envoy proxy and Istio service mesh. -->
</p>

Most likely, you can find me on the 3rd floor at Siebel Center for Computer Science at Urbana, IL (or at a cafe in Urbana-Champaign)<br>

## Other Facts about me

### Sports
I love doing all different kinds of sports such as basketball, running, swimming, freediving, tennis, and more.
<br>

### Backpacking
In the past, I enjoyed rather extreme backpacking trips, mostly solo trips. Extreme as in no plan, no reservation (hotel or transportation), just a backpack and taking a flight to a new place by myself, not knowing where to go other than the first city. It is like an unopened gift box. I did it intentionally to meet as many new and diverse people as possible and hidden gems in the world. And it definitely worked.
This extreme style of traveling started from a solo backpacking that I made at 15 years old to Japan where I lost all the cashes I had and cried on a random street.
The places I have been are from Japan, Thailand, India, Nepal, Myammar, Cambodia, Morroco, all Europe countries except for the north part, etc.
