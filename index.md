<p>
 My name is Gangmuk Lim. I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student at the Computer Science Department of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, working with Professor <a href="https://pbg.cs.illinois.edu">Brighten Godfrey</a>. Before starting my Ph.D., I earned my Bachelor and Master at the Computer Science at UNIST, South Korea, working with Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/myeongjae/">Myeongjae Jeon</a>.
</p>

<p>
My research is improving performance of microservice application in cloud and improvining reliability of cluster management system. Currently, I am focusing on designing new service mesh system to minimize end-to-end latency and monetary cost of large scale microservice application.
</p>

<p>
Previously, I was working on building system for machine learning application that improves GPU resource utilization and throughput.
