<p>
 My name is Gangmuk Lim. I am a ~~2nd~~3rd year Ph.D. student at the Computer Science Department of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, working with Professor <a href="https://pbg.cs.illinois.edu">Brighten Godfrey</a>. Before starting my Ph.D., I earned my Bachelor and Master at the Computer Science at UNIST, South Korea, working with Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/myeongjae/">Myeongjae Jeon</a>.
</p>

<p>
My research primarily revolves around improving performance of microservice application in the cloud, reliability of cluster management system, and performance & resource utilization for machine learning applications. 
The most recent research project focuses on designing new service mesh system to minimize end-to-end latency and monetary costs associated with large scale microservice applications spanning geo-distributed multiple clusters in the cloud.
<!-- I am actively on the lookout to work on new projects around distributed systems for machine learning. If you are interested in working with me, please don't hesitate to reach out at gangmuk2 at illinois dot edu. -->
</p>

<p>
Previously, I also worked on building a resource efficient machine learning training system with smart GPU sharing (co-locating multiple DNN training jobs within a GPU) and improves throughput with higher GPU resource utilization.
