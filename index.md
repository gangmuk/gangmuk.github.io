<p>
I am a third year Ph.D. student at the Computer Science Department of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am working with Professor <a href="https://pbg.cs.illinois.edu">Brighten Godfrey</a>, and also closely working with Professor <a href="https://radhikam.web.illinois.edu/">Radhika Mittal</a>. 

Also, I earned my Bachelor and Master at the Computer Science at UNIST, South Korea, working with Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/myeongjae/">Myeongjae Jeon</a>.
</p>

<p>
I am broadly interested in system and networking. Some keywords for my current interests are Request routing, Infrastructure for LLM inference applications, Optimizing microservices-based application in cloud, and ML for system.
</p>

<!-- <p>
The most recent research project focuses on optimizing request routing in microservice applications in multi-cluster environment to minimize end-to-end latency and egress bandwidht costs associated with large scale microservice applications spanning geo-distributed multiple clusters in the cloud.
</p>

<p>
Previously, I also worked on building a resource efficient machine learning training system with smart GPU sharing (co-locating multiple DNN training jobs within a GPU) and improves throughput with higher GPU resource utilization.
</p> -->

Most likely, you can find me on 3rd floor at Siebel Center for Computer Science at Urbana, IL.<br>
